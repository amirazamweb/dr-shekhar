                    <h3>Conditions Treated by Shoulder Replacement</h3>

                    <p>
                    Shoulder replacement surgery is typically recommended for individuals experiencing severe shoulder pain or limited function due to:
                    <ul>
                        <li><span style="font-weight: 600;">Osteoarthritis:</span> Degeneration of the cartilage in the shoulder joint, leading to pain and stiffness.</li>
                        <li><span style="font-weight: 600;">Rheumatoid Arthritis:</span> An autoimmune disease that causes joint inflammation and damage.</li>
                        <li><span style="font-weight: 600;">Rotator Cuff Tears:</span> In some cases where the rotator cuff is severely damaged and cannot be repaired, shoulder replacement may be necessary.</li>
                        <li><span style="font-weight: 600;">Fractures:</span> Complex fractures that involve the shoulder joint and cannot be repaired with other methods.</li>
                        <li><span style="font-weight: 600;">Shoulder Instability:</span> Chronic dislocations or instability that leads to pain and loss of function.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>

                    <h3>Types of Shoulder Replacement</h3>
                    <p>
                    Dr. Shekhar Srivastav offers various types of shoulder replacement surgeries, depending on the patient's condition and needs:
                    <ul>
                        <li><span style="font-weight: 600;">Total Shoulder Replacement (TSA):</span> This is the most common type, in which both the ball (humeral head) and socket (glenoid) are replaced with prosthetic components.</li>
                        <li><span style="font-weight: 600;">Reverse Shoulder Replacement (RSA):</span> This procedure is typically recommended for patients with massive rotator cuff tears and arthritis. The ball and socket are reversed to allow the deltoid muscle to compensate for the lost rotator cuff function.</li>
                        <li><span style="font-weight: 600;">Partial Shoulder Replacement:</span> In this procedure, only the damaged part of the shoulder joint is replaced, while the remaining healthy portions are preserved.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>

                    <h3>The Procedure: What to Expect</h3>
                    <p>
                    houlder replacement surgery is typically performed under general anesthesia or regional anesthesia, depending on the patient's health and preferences. The surgery involves making small incisions, through which the damaged parts of the joint are removed, and prosthetic components are inserted. <br>The procedure usually takes around 1-2 hours, depending on the complexity. Post-surgery, patients are typically monitored in a recovery room for a few hours before being discharged. Most patients can go home the same day or the following day.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Recovery After Shoulder Replacement</h3>

                        <li> <span style="font-weight: 600;">Initial Recovery:</span> After surgery, patients may experience pain and swelling, which can be managed with prescribed medications. A sling is often worn to support the shoulder during the initial healing phase.</li>
                        <li> <span style="font-weight: 600;">Physical Therapy:</span> Rehabilitation is crucial for optimal recovery. Dr. Shekhar Srivastav recommends a personalized physical therapy program to help patients regain strength, flexibility, and range of motion.</li>
                        <li> <span style="font-weight: 600;">Timeline:</span> Patients can usually return to light activities within 6-8 weeks, but it may take 3-6 months to fully recover. The timeline varies based on the individualâ€™s health and adherence to the rehabilitation program.</li>
                    </ul>
