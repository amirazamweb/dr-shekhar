                    <h3>What is Frozen Shoulder?</h3>
                    <p>
                    Frozen Shoulder, also known as Adhesive Capsulitis, is a condition characterized by pain, stiffness, and restricted movement in the shoulder joint. It occurs when the capsule surrounding the shoulder joint thickens and tightens, leading to progressive loss of motion. This condition can severely affect daily activities, making simple movements like reaching overhead or behind the back extremely difficult. <br><br>
                    Dr. Shekhar Srivastav, a renowned orthopedic specialist in Delhi, offers Frozen Shoulder Release Surgery, a highly effective treatment for patients who do not respond to non-surgical treatments like physiotherapy, medications, or injections.

                    Frozen Shoulder Release is a minimally invasive surgical procedure that helps restore shoulder mobility by releasing the tightened shoulder capsule. The procedure is performed using either:
                        <ul>
